###### Technology stack

JavaScript: Used as the primary programming language to develop the frontend logic of the application due to its wide support and versatility in web development.

React: Chosen as the frontend library for building user interfaces, enabling the creation of reusable UI components and facilitating efficient rendering of dynamic data.

Redux: Utilized for managing the application's global state, ensuring centralized data management across components and enabling predictable state changes.

React-router-dom: Implemented for client-side routing within the React application, enabling navigation between different views or pages without a full page reload.

React-hook-form: Integrated to handle form validation and management in React components, providing a straightforward and efficient way to validate user input.

React-modal: Used to create and manage modal dialogs within the application, improving user experience by displaying content or actions in a focused overlay without leaving the current page.

Redux-persist: Implemented for persisting Redux state in the browser's local storage, ensuring state persistence across sessions and page reloads for enhanced user experience.

Redux-thunk: Employed as a middleware for Redux to handle asynchronous actions, enabling Redux to manage side effects such as API calls and dispatching multiple actions based on asynchronous results.

Axios: Utilized for making HTTP requests from the client-side to interact with the backend API, handling asynchronous data fetching and updating operations seamlessly.
